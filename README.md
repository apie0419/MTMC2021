# Execution

To obtain the final results for mtmc, you only need to 

1. write your configuration in `config/config.yaml`
2. run the scripts in `pipeline` step by step (from step 1 to 5)

# Model Weight

If you want to train the  model on your own, please follow the instructions in `reid_model` and `mct_model`.

We also prepared our trained weight here:
