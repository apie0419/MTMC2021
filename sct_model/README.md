## How to train your own model

`bash train.sh`

Remember to change DATASET.ROOT in configs/tracklet_pair_connectivity.yaml to the root of your own cropped data, change MODEL.APPEARANCE.WEIGHTS to the path of your own well trained appearance model. TRACKLET.WINDOW_lEN indicates the length of the silding window for trackletpair sampling.
